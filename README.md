# WallPaper change (Gnome and Xfce)

Hi, I am a tool that works with bash.  
I can change the wallpaper of the current pc 😁.  
If you want to prank someone you can thanks to me. (provided that the target computer is on gnome or xfce in graphical interface)  

## Runing Locally

just git clone me and give me the performance rights 😊.  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/antoinealexisb/wallpaper.git
$ cd wallpaper
$ chmod +x farce.sh

$ ./farce.sh
```

I also have a slightly less soft version, just put an argument (any argument 😂😂).  
example:
`$ ./farce.sh hello`
`$ ./farce.sh coucou`
